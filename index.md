## Issues

### Fix the Affordable Housing Crisis
We have an affordable housing crisis in Washington.  Rapidly rising rents are pushing many low-income and fixed-income residents out of the District.  As our city’s population moves toward 1 million people, we must make sure that there is enough low-income housing and workforce housing for all.  The District is not the only city facing an affordable housing crisis, but our needs are acute.  The DC Democratic State Committee must serve as policy clearinghouse, finding ideas that work elsewhere, analyzing whether they will work in the District, and then, most importantly, pushing these ideas to the Mayor and to the Council.  All four of us on the Ward 3 Blue Wave slate have worked to ensure that there is fair and equitable housing for all.  We are committed to holding our elected leaders to their promises while finding and supporting affordable housing solutions that work.
